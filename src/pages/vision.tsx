          <p>
            Ethereum gives you the power to trust. It enables the development of
            systems of automated and executable agreements that ensure that all
            counterparties are treated fairly throughout a transaction. Any
            system that is currently centralized can be decentralized using
            Ethereum.
          </p>

            CODIFIED TRUST
          </Header>
          <p>
            On the Ethereum blockchain, a smart contract is immutable and
            trustless. The contract is not a person or a company with a hidden
            agenda or uncertain motivations. The contract runs exactly as
            programmed. If developed correctly, it cannot be manipulated or
            corrupted. Since Ethereum tracks every transaction non-repudiable on
            the blockchain, there is always a trusted record.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an uncertaint market, Ethereum gives you the freedom to conduct
            your business trustlessly.

                  Ethereum applications can run without fear of downtime, fraud,
                  third-party interference, tampering of data, or censorship by
                  a centralized authority.

                <p>
                  The Ethereum blockchain can provide better protection against
                  fraud, remove reliance on paper contracts, and spur greater
                  investment through easy property ownership and transfer.

                <p>
                  The Ethereum blockchain allows smart contracts to
                  automatically execute payments without middlemen and comes to
                  a consensus every 15 seconds.
